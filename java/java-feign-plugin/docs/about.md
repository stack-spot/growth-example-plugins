Integrate OpenFeign in your Java project, with a sample Feign Client.

This **Plugin** adds OpenFeign dependencies to your project and creates a sample class with a dummy json request.

For more information about **OpenFeign** and how to deploy locally, see the [**spring-cloud-feign**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-openfeign/docs/current/reference/html/#spring-cloud-feign) page.
